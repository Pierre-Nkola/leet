This repo was inspired by a list published by a renowned Tech engineer on Blind, an anonimous app where tech workers(mostly) express their mind. The initial idea suggested that mastering those 75 problems is enough to crack any software engineer coding interview.

This repo is a testimony of me trying.

Areas where I need improvements:
1- Dynamic Programming
2- DFS
3- BFS
4- backtracking
